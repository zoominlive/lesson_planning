# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 using TypeScript and follows a modern component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a comprehensive design system featuring custom childcare-themed colors
- **Component Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility and consistency
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management with optimistic updates
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API pattern built with Express.js:

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript using ESM modules
- **Framework**: Express.js with structured route handling and middleware
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend for consistent validation
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage interface pattern allowing for flexible data persistence implementations

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, successfully integrated and operational:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured with Neon Database)
- **ORM**: Drizzle with TypeScript for compile-time type safety and serverless connection pooling
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in the shared directory
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Seeding**: Automated database seeding with sample data for development

### Database Integration Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**: PostgreSQL database successfully integrated
- Database schema pushed and synchronized
- DatabaseStorage class implemented replacing in-memory storage
- Sample data seeded for milestones, materials, and activities
- All API endpoints validated and working with persistent data

### Core Data Models
- **Users**: Teacher profiles with classroom assignments
- **Milestones**: Developmental milestones categorized by domain (Social, Emotional, Cognitive, Physical)
- **Materials**: Classroom materials with inventory tracking and location management
- **Activities**: Educational activities with age ranges, objectives, and material requirements
- **Lesson Plans**: Weekly planning containers with teacher assignments
- **Scheduled Activities**: Time-slotted activities within lesson plans

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently implemented as a foundational structure with user models in place, designed for future authentication implementation. The system includes teacher profiles and classroom-based organization.

## File Upload and Media Management
The application integrates Uppy for file handling:

- **File Upload**: Uppy dashboard and drag-drop components
- **Cloud Storage**: Google Cloud Storage integration
- **AWS S3**: Alternative storage option with Uppy S3 plugin
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in upload progress indicators

## Development and Build Process
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR and TypeScript checking
- **Production Build**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend compilation
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type checking
- **Development Tools**: Replit-specific plugins for enhanced development experience

## API Design Patterns
The REST API follows consistent patterns:

- **CRUD Operations**: Standardized endpoints for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with consistent response formats
- **Request Validation**: Zod schema validation for all incoming data
- **Response Logging**: Structured logging for API requests and responses

## UI/UX Design System
The application features a cohesive design system:

- **Color Palette**: Custom childcare-themed colors (coral red, turquoise, sky blue, mint green, soft yellow)
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizing and weight hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Standardized margin and padding scales
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling and behavior
- **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring WCAG compliance
